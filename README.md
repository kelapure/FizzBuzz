FizzBuzz
========

Solve the FizzBuzz problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for
the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Plan
 1. Create Junit Tests to test the FizzBuzz Problem
 2. Create Implementation class that solves the problem
 3. Create JAX-RS web service that responds to a front end UI
 4. Create a maven/gradle build to build a war file
 5. Create the front-end UI using XHR and HTML to talk to the rest service
 6. Delivery pipeline for promotion from staging to production
